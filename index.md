Ophthalmology uses many devices to monitor and record a patient’s visual
function. After extracting historical information from a device, the
data must be de-identified before submitting to SOURCE, the Sight
OUtcomes Research CollaborativE
(<https://www.sourcecollaborative.org/>).

The two functions in the package DeIDmachinedata can be used, along with
crosswalks provided by IT, to complete the data preparation. The
functions loadxwalks() and fileDeID() are flexible enough to use with
data extracted from many devices.
