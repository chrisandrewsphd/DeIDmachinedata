\arguments{
\item{filetodeid}{character. Filename of a single flat file to de-identify.}

\item{fd_varname_mrn}{character. Name of MRN variable in file to de-identify. Default is "PAT_MRN".}

\item{variablestoremove}{character vector. Names of variables in extraction file to remove. Default is \code{character(0)}, no variables to remove.}

\item{variablestoblank}{character vector. Names of variables in extraction file to blank. The variable will remain in the output file but will be '' for all rows. Default is \code{character(0)}, no variables to blank.}

\item{datevariablestodateshift}{character vector. Names of variables that are dates and should be date-shifted. Default is \code{character(0)}, no variables to shift.}

\item{dateformat}{character. Format of date variables in the extraction file.  Default is "\%Y-\%m-\%d" corresponding to 4-digit year, hyphen, 2-digit month, hyphen, 2-digit day.}

\item{datetimevariablestodateshift}{character vector. Names of variables that are datetimes and should be date-shifted. Default is \code{character(0)}, no variables to shift.}

\item{datetimeformat}{character. Format of datetime variables in the extraction file.  Default is "\%Y-\%m-\%d \%H:\%M:\%OS" corresponding to 4-digit year, hyphen, 2-digit month, hyphen, 2-digit day, space, 2-digit (24) hour, colon, 2-digit minute, colon 2-digit second.}

\item{separator}{character. Field separator in filetodeid (input file). Default is \code{","}.}

\item{separator_out}{character. Field separator to use in outputfile. Default is \code{","}.}

\item{xwalk}{data.frame containing crosswalk information. Usually the output from \code{\link[=loadxwalks]{loadxwalks()}}.}

\item{compare_mrn_numeric}{logical. Should MRNs be compared as numeric variables? Usually this is a good idea because leading 0s may have been dropped during processing. Default is whatever was used to create xwalk, which is \code{TRUE} by default.}

\item{outputfile}{character. Name of file to write de-identified data. If \code{NULL} (the default) the data are not written, but only returned from the function. An additional option is the special value \code{"SOURCE_"}, which causes the output to be written to the same filename as the input but prepended with "SOURCE_".}

\item{usefread}{If \code{TRUE} (default), use \code{data.table::fread()} and \code{data.table::fwrite()}. If \code{FALSE}, use \code{utils::read.csv()} and \code{utils::write.csv()}. \code{TRUE} is usually preferable as \code{FALSE} results in double quotes around almost all values when producing the output file.}

\item{verbose}{integer. Higher values produce more output to console.  Default is 0, no output.}
}
\value{
(invisibly) data.frame (even if \code{usefread == TRUE}) with variables tokenized, date-shifted, removed, and/or blanked, as requested.
}
\description{
This function is used to de-identify a flat file using a crosswalk (with
specific structure, see \code{loadxwalks()}).
De-identification options include replacing a patient MRN by a tokenized MRN
(using the crosswalk), removing a column, 'blanking' a column
(the column remains in the dataset but all values are ""), and shifting a
date or datetime variable (using the crosswalk).
