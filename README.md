Ophthalmology uses many devices to monitor and record a patientâ€™s visual function. After extracting historical information from a device, the data must be de-identified before submitting to SOURCE, the Sight OUtcomes Research CollaborativE (https://www.sourcecollaborative.org/).

The two functions in the package DeIDmachinedata can be used, along with crosswalks provided by IT, to complete the data preparation. The functions loadxwalks() and fileDeID() are flexible enough to use with data extracted from many devices.
